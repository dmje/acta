# Thirty8 Analytics and Cookie Popup Helper

A really simple plugin which gives users fields to add their GTM / GA codes.

We then provide a cookie popup on the front end - if user says ok, the GTM/GA codes are included. If they don't, they aren't.

Settings can be found under Settings > Analytics which includes some simple options for colours.

- Initial commit of v1.0
- Very basic options
- Only one type, "bottom bar" - but conditional in functions.php means more would be easily possible in the future...
