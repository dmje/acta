## Thirty8 Draft Content Helper

### Overview

This plugin helps you keep track of your content as you migrate / populate a new site. At the moment it's very simple - just has a content status indicator on each page of post / page editor and a front end display as well. 

Over time it's going to grow a bit, with some integration with some of the other tools we've been building to help shuffle content around / scrape it / otherwise reduce time fannying about when going through the process of populating a new client site.

- Lots of time using this on client sites, plus some initial thinking about how to integrate with ContentSifter...
- Made a few UI tweaks


#### 30th November 2020

- In a state now where it can be used on other sites, so going to try it on the WHL build site and see how well it works in this basic form.
- Note that I have just manually copied the plugin over onto the WHL build - no symlinks or anything cunning just yet. So any updates will have to be manually copied across.
